# AGP
Code for the AGP subject

The contents of this branch contain Projects 1 and Project 3, which are exercises belonging to courses up to 2019-2020.
- **Project 1** Is an example of a graphical application using the well known Qt framework. In this projects, students had to develop 2D user interface, play with the different widget layouts available and other features present in Qt, and also implement a custom widget that draws simple primitives.
- **Project 3** Is a OpenGL-based 3D engine using Qt to create the window and the OpenGL context. In this project, students are required to implement a deferred renderer and some of the more advanced techniques explained in class (e.g. relief mapping, SSAO, bloom, environment mapping, PBR, water effects, etc).
